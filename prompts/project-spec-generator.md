# Project spec generation instructions

My goals is to generate a project spec so that I can utilise it as a guide to build a project.  So the spec should include what are the core features and also probably what are the schema tables (including the relationships) that is required to build the out the backend.

## Instructions

1. Generate out the project spec as a markdown file under the `project-details` folder. Name the file accordingly.
2. Use the sample project spec as a template to generate your own project spec.

Here is the sample project spec. Feel free to use it as a template to generate your own project spec.
